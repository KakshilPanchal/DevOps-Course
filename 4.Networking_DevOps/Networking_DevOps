What is a Network ?
When two or more computers and computing devices connected together with each other through communication channels, such as cables or wireless media and sharing some files, 
then it is called a Network.

A network is used to:
Allow the connected devices to communicate with each other.
Enable multiple users to share devices over the network, such as music and video servers, printers and scanners.

Types of Networks
There are different types of network. But the main two are LAN and WAN üëâ
1- LAN (Local Area Network) - interconnects computer within a limited area, such as residences, schools. e.g:- Wi-Fi, Ethernet
2- MAN(Metropolitan area network) - used in metropolitan area (cities).
3- WAN (Wide Area Network) - extends LAN over a large geographic area. e.g:- optical fiber cable
4-SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) - used in submarine.

                                                                                                                                  1.OSI Model
                                                                                                                                  
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. 
Each layer has a specific role in managing aspects like hardware, addressing, routing, and application-level interactions. 
The OSI model is used to understand and design network architectures, and it helps in troubleshooting network communication issues.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures that data arrives in the correct order and without errors, 
while Internet Protocol (IP) is responsible for routing data packets to their destinations. Together, they form the backbone of Internet communication.

                                                                                                                            2. Protocols :TCP/UDP/IP
                                                                                                                   
A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network. 
It ensures standardized communication, allowing different systems to understand and interact with each other. 
Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP

i. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
Description: TCP operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. It establishes a connection between two devices before data exchange, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of information.

Functionality: It breaks data into packets, assigns sequence numbers, and uses acknowledgment messages to guarantee delivery. It‚Äôs connection-oriented, meaning it sets up, maintains, and terminates a connection for data exchange.

ii. UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
Description: Also operating at the transport layer, UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers minimal services. 
It‚Äôs like a ‚Äòfire and forget‚Äô approach for data transmission.

Functionality: It sends data without establishing a connection, providing low latency communication. 
However, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery or order, making it suitable for real-time applications like video streaming or online gaming.


iii. IP (Internet Protocol):
Description: IP functions at the network layer and is a fundamental part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. 
It handles addressing and routing to ensure data packets reach their intended destinations.

Functionality: IP assigns unique IP addresses to devices and uses routing tables to direct data across networks. 
It‚Äôs responsible for the logical connection between different devices on the Internet.

In short, TCP ensures reliable and ordered communication with a connection-oriented approach, UDP prioritizes speed and is connectionless, and IP manages the addressing and routing for data packets across networks. Together, they form the backbone of internet communication.

Ports
                                                                                                                                                  
Ports are essential for directing network traffic to specific applications or services on devices.

DevOps engineers need a solid understanding of ports to manage the networking aspects of application deployment, configuration, and maintenance. 
This knowledge is crucial for building robust, scalable, and secure infrastructures in a DevOps environment.

Routing is the process of directing data packets from a source to a destination across a network. 
Routers use routing tables and protocols to decide the path for data transmission, ensuring efficient and reliable communication between devices.


                                                                                                                                        5. DNS
                                                                                                                                        
DNS, or Domain Name System, translates easy-to-remember domain names to computer-friendly IP addresses, 
helps find mail servers, balances web traffic among servers, redirects requests, performs reverse lookups, and speeds up responses through caching. 
It‚Äôs a vital system that ensures efficient and reliable communication on the internet.


DNS Record Types:
1- A Record (Address Record): Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
2- AAAA Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
3- CNAME Record (Canonical Name): Alias of one domain to another.
4- MX Record (Mail Exchange): Specifies mail servers for the domain.
5- NS Record (Name Server): Identifies authoritative DNS servers for the domain.

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is like a secure tunnel for your internet connection. 
It encrypts your data and routes it through a server, making your online activities more private and secure

VPNs allow professionals to securely connect to remote servers, access cloud resources, and perform maintenance tasks without compromising data security. 
It ensures a private and encrypted connection, crucial when dealing with sensitive configurations, deployments, or infrastructure management tasks.

IPv4
This is a 32 bit IP address, means it contains a combo of 32 (1 and 0's). 
In this version of IP address there are 4 groups or Octets(8 bits) and each octet is represented by a decimal value in the address. It is easy to remember.

IPv6
This IP address contain 128 bits. We use IPv6 because we have a shortage of IPv4, almost all IPv4 is used now and this is the reason IPv6 is commonly seen nowadays. 
This address is represented by a hexadecimal value.

There is an organization called IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) who divides the IP address into different classes
